## Test with Jest
In this repo I wanted to better understand JavaScript testing with Jest, a magnificent testing suite for JavaScript. The provided code includes:

  - How to write tests (specs)
  - How to group tests
  - How to take advantage of Snapshot tests
  - Feature WorkFlow tips

This repository is related to the Test with Jest course by [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/)


### Development

Open your Terminal and run these commands:

Run all tests:
```sh
$ yarn jest
```

Run model.js tests:
```sh
$ yarn jest model
```
